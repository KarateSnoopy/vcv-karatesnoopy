# KarateSnoopy's 2D grid sequencer for VCV Rack

Here's my 2D grid sequencer for VCV Rack that's somewhat inspired by Rene. 
Yeah, I know Jeremy Wen (JW) also released a grid sequencer but I was making this when he released his and I didn't look at his source.  

I started with the Fundamentals SEQ-3 and added 3 pages of dynamically changeable UI controls to set pitch, gate, and skip as well as added a pattern param with CV control with 8 patterns built in.
