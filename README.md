# KarateSnoopy's 2D grid sequencer for VCV Rack

Here's my 2D grid sequencer for VCV Rack that's somewhat inspired by Rene.
Yeah, I know Jeremy Wen (JW) also released a grid sequencer but I was making this when he released his and I didn't look at his source. 
I started with the Fundamentals SEQ-3 and added 3 pages of dynamically changable UI controls to set pitch, gate, and skip as well as added a pattern param with CV control with 8 patterns built in.

Anyway, it compiles for v0.4.0.  I'll try to release binaires for it tommarow for folks that can't build.

Here's my video walkthrough of it: https://youtu.be/5Bw99jjyd-g
Lemme know about bugs or features requests.
